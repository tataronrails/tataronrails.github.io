Almaz Bikchurin and team consistently delivered all 3 from the beginning through to the end, but the customer experience was the true differentiator.<br /><br />

To start, Al and team answered my questions without using a bunch of technical jargon. As important, they made recommendations that improved key aspects of my solution.<br /><br />

Al and team also demonstrated flexibility. I made many changes along the way. I cannot recall a time that I was told “no.” They always seem to come back with solutions, which gave me greater confidence in their ability to deliver.<br /><br />

Lastly, they exercised grave patience. I came into this process with no knowledge of how things were done, so patience was going to be critical. At no point in the process was I pushed to make a decision. I was given sufficient space to think things through, which was empowering in many ways.<br />

Overall, Al and team provided a great experience. I would absolutely recommend them to a friend, especially one with limited to no experience in this space.".

I worked with two other highly rated developers at the same time we engaged Almaz and his team. We wanted to split up the work among a few teams to get it done quicker and minimize the risk of being dependent on any one dev shop. Tartar on Rails far exceeded our expectations and did a much better job than the two other development firms. After about two months we started sending 100% of work to Almaz and his team. We have been working with them ever since. We are very happy with their work. They do excellent work and provide great customer service. I highly recommend Tartar on Rails".
